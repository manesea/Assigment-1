I chose this website because I thought this was a cool demo. It was written in JavaScript and uses ThreeJS as a WebGL library. It's a small voxel engine and shows off what it can do. The environments are also destructible by using different types of weapons to destroy the area. I think this demo does a great job at showing the 3D capabilities of WebGL.
